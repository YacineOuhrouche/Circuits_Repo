## Circuit Description üõ†Ô∏è  

- The **555 timer** is set up in **astable mode** to generate a square wave PWM signal.  
- The **potentiometer** adjusts the charge/discharge time, varying the PWM duty cycle.  
- The PWM output (pin 3 of 555) drives the **base of the 2N2222 transistor** through a resistor.  
- The transistor switches the motor ON and OFF rapidly according to the PWM signal.
