# 📡 Signal Interface Circuits

Welcome to the **Signal Interface** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **Signal Interface circuits** that help with modulating, converting, and routing signals in communication systems. These circuits are essential for ensuring proper signal transfer between components, such as antennas, RF systems, and other communication devices.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
