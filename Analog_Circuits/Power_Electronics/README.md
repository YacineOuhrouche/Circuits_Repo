# 🔌 Power Electronics

Welcome to the **Power Electronics** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates how to build **Power Electronics circuits** using components like **diodes, transistors, capacitors, and inductors**. Power electronics are essential in controlling and converting electrical power efficiently in various applications, such as motor drives, power supplies, renewable energy systems, and more.

Power electronics circuits are designed to manage high-power systems, converting electricity from one form to another, improving efficiency, and providing more control over the power flow.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the circuit's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The circuit simulation or breadboard setup
