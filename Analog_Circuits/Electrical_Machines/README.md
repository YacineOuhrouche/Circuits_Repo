# ⚡ Electrical Machines

Welcome to the **Electrical Machines** repository! 🎉  
This collection demonstrates various **electrical machines**, including motors, generators, transformers, and more. These machines are fundamental in energy conversion processes—such as mechanical to electrical energy and vice versa—and are critical in both industrial and consumer applications.

Each folder contains:

✅ A brief explanation of the machine's functionality  
✅ A schematic image  
✅ The machine setup and/or working principles
