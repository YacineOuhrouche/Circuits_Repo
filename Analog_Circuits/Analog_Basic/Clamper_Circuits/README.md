# 📘 Multiplexer – A Comprehensive Guide

## ✨ Introduction
A **Multiplexer (MUX)** is a combinational circuit that selects one of many input signals and forwards it to a single output line. It is widely used in **data routing, communication systems, and signal processing**.

Multiplexers reduce the number of data paths required and enable efficient resource utilization in digital circuits.

## 🔹 Types of Multiplexer
Multiplexers are categorized based on the number of input lines:

1. **2:1 Multiplexer** – Selects between 2 inputs using 1 select line.
2. **4:1 Multiplexer** – Selects between 4 inputs using 2 select lines.
3. **8:1 Multiplexer** – Selects between 8 inputs using 3 select lines.
4. **16:1 Multiplexer** – Selects between 16 inputs using 4 select lines.

## 📌 2:1 Multiplexer

🔹 **How It Works:**
- Uses **one select line (S)** to choose between **two inputs (I0, I1)**.
- The selected input appears at the output (Y).

📜 **Truth Table:**

| S | Y  |
|---|----|
| 0 | I0 |
| 1 | I1 |

## 📌 4:1 Multiplexer

🔹 **How It Works:**
- Uses **two select lines (S1, S0)** to choose between **four inputs (I0, I1, I2, I3)**.

📜 **Truth Table:**

| S1 | S0 | Y  |
|----|----|----|
|  0 |  0 | I0 |
|  0 |  1 | I1 |
|  1 |  0 | I2 |
|  1 |  1 | I3 |

## 📌 8:1 Multiplexer

🔹 **How It Works:**
- Uses **three select lines (S2, S1, S0)** to choose between **eight inputs (I0 to I7)**.

📜 **Truth Table (Partial):**

| S2 | S1 | S0 | Y  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  0 |  0 |  0 | I0 |
|  0 |  0 |  1 | I1 |
|  0 |  1 |  0 | I2 |
| ...| ...| ...| ...|
|  1 |  1 |  1 | I7 |

## 📌 16:1 Multiplexer

🔹 **How It Works:**
- Uses **four select lines (S3, S2, S1, S0)** to choose between **sixteen inputs (I0 to I15)**.

📜 **Truth Table (Partial):**

| S3 | S2 | S1 | S0 | Y  |
|----|----|----|----|----|
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  0 | I0 |
|  0 |  0 |  0 |  1 | I1 |
|  0 |  0 |  1 |  0 | I2 |
| ...| ...| ...| ...| ...|
|  1 |  1 |  1 |  1 | I15 |
