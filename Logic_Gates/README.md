# Logic Circuits Using Transistors

Welcome to the **Logic Circuits Using Transistors** repository! 🎉  
This folder showcases how basic logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND) can be **built using transistors** (BJT).

Each folder contains:

✅ A short explanation of what the gate does  
✅ A link to more information  
✅  A schematic image

## Quick Links to Each Gate

| Gate | Link |
|--|--|
| AND Gate | [AND Gate Folder](./AND_gate) |
| NOT Gate | [NOT Gate Folder](./NOT_gate) |
| NAND Gate | [NAND Gate Folder](./NAND_gate) |
