# ⚡ Boost Converter (Step-Up)  

A **Boost Converter** is a DC-DC power converter that **steps up a lower input voltage** to a **higher output voltage** efficiently. It is commonly used in applications where a higher output voltage is required from a lower input voltage.

## 🔹 How It Works  

### **1️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is ON**  
- The **MOSFET (switch) is closed**, allowing current to flow from the **input voltage (V_in)** through the **inductor (L)** to the **diode (D)** and **capacitor (C)**.  
- The **inductor stores energy** in its **magnetic field** as current increases.  
- The **diode (D) is reverse-biased** (OFF) and does not conduct.  

### **2️⃣ When the MOSFET Switch is OFF**  
- The **MOSFET turns OFF**, stopping the direct current flow from **V_in**.  
- The **inductor resists sudden changes in current** and releases its stored energy.  
- The **diode becomes forward-biased**, allowing the stored energy to flow into the **capacitor (C)**, which increases the output voltage.  
- The **capacitor smooths the output voltage**, reducing ripple.

### **Why the output voltage is higher?**
- The boost converter increases the voltage because the energy stored in the inductor is released at a higher voltage, with the output voltage determined by the duty cycle (D) of the switching signal:
  
  \[ V_{out} = \frac{V_{in}}{1 - D} \]
